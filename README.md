# Weight Tracking App

## Overview

The Weight Tracking App is designed to help users monitor and manage their weight effectively. This application addresses the need for a user-friendly platform where individuals can log their daily weight, set weight goals, and receive notifications when they reach their target weight. It aims to promote healthier habits by making weight tracking accessible and straightforward.

## Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of the Weight Tracking App is to provide users with an intuitive interface for recording their weight daily and tracking their progress over time. Key user needs addressed by the app include:

- A simple login system for user authentication.
- The ability to enter daily weight records easily.
- A feature to set and monitor goal weight.
- Notifications to inform users when they reach their goal weight.

## Screens and Features

To support user needs and produce a user-centered UI, the app includes the following screens and features:

1. **Login Screen**: Allows users to enter their credentials or create a new account. The design focuses on simplicity and ease of use, with clearly labeled fields for username and password.
   
2. **Weight Entry Screen**: Users can log their daily weight. The interface is designed with a clear input field and a submit button, making it easy for users to record their weight quickly.
   
3. **Weight History Screen**: Displays a grid view of all recorded weights, providing users with a visual representation of their progress over time. This helps users stay motivated and informed.

The UI designs were successful because they prioritize user experience through clarity and simplicity, reducing friction during the input process and enhancing engagement with the app.

## Coding Process

The coding process for the app was approached systematically, starting with the design and layout of the user interface, followed by implementing the backend functionality. I utilized Android Studio's features to streamline development, including the use of `RecyclerView` for displaying weight entries and SQLite for data storage.

To ensure that these techniques are effective in future projects, I plan to continue employing modular coding practices and emphasizing user-centered design principles throughout the development process.

## Testing and Functional Assurance

To ensure the code was functional, I conducted thorough testing by simulating various user interactions with the app. This included logging in, entering weights, and checking the notification system. Testing is crucial as it identifies bugs or areas for improvement, revealing insights into how users might interact with the app.

## Innovation and Challenges

Throughout the app development process, I encountered challenges such as optimizing the user interface for different screen sizes and ensuring smooth navigation between screens. I had to innovate by using responsive design techniques and applying Android's built-in components to maintain a cohesive look and feel across
